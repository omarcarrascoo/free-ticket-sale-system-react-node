# Free Ticket Sale System (Node and React)

Welcome to the Free Ticket Sale System repository! 🎟️

## Introduction
I originally developed this ticket sales system for a client, but unfortunately, their events didn't quite light up the night as expected. 😔 Now, I'm passing it on to you, absolutely FREE! This system is tailor-made for event creators who want to save on pesky commissions (except for Stripe, of course)! 💃💰

Let's empower event planners everywhere and make event management a breeze! 🚀 #NoMoreCommissions #FreeTicketSaleSystem

## Environment
This project is built using Node.js and React. Setting it up is a breeze. You just need to modify the variables in the .env file and provide your Stripe public key. After that, you'll be all set to start selling tickets.

## Admin Panel
Please note that I haven't included the admin panel in this repository, as it's a part of a separate project due to confidentiality agreements (NDAs). However, for a minimum viable product (MVP), you can easily use Postman to upload events and then create the panel by fetching data from the API.

Happy ticket selling!
